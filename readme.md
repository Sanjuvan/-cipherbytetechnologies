### IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
Iris flower has three species- 1. setosa 2. versicolor 3. virginica, which differs according to their measurements. 
Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.
Dataset contain:
1. Iris-setosa-50
2. Iris-versicolor - 50
3. Iris-virginica -50
   
##### Model used for deployment : KNeighborsClassifier

##### Highest Accuracy Score - 1.00

###### Other model used :
1. LogisticRegression
2. DecisionTreeClassifier
3. LinearDiscriminantAnalysis
4. GaussianNB
5. SVC
   
I completed the task successfully and made a website to predict the class using machine learning model.
